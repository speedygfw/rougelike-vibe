2.  **Manage Resources**: Don't waste simple potions. Save them for tough fights.
3.  **Use Doorways**: Fight enemies one at a time in narrow corridors.
4.  **Watch the Time**: Day/Night cycles are cosmetic in the village, but deep in the dungeon, darkness is eternal.
5.  **Run Away**: If you're low on HP, use a Teleport scroll or run to a cleared room to heal.

Good luck, hero. Aethelgard depends on you.
